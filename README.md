## 🔎 Business Context

Modern large-scale fulfillment networks face complex operational challenges:

- Uncertain customer demand  
- Multi-warehouse inventory balancing  
- Supplier lead-time variability  
- Stockouts and overstock costs  
- Delivery inefficiencies and routing delays  
- Lack of controlled experimentation for strategy evaluation  

Even small inefficiencies at scale result in significant financial impact.

This platform simulates and optimizes a distributed fulfillment ecosystem — combining supply chain planning and last-mile execution into a unified data-driven system.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Forecast product demand across warehouses  
- Optimize inventory allocation and reorder decisions  
- Assign orders intelligently to warehouses  
- Optimize driver assignment and delivery routes  
- Predict delivery ETA  
- Compare strategies using A/B testing  
- Minimize total operational cost

## 🤖 Machine Learning Components

### Demand Forecasting
Predict product-level demand across warehouses using:
- Historical sales
- Seasonal features
- Lead-time variability

### ETA Prediction
Estimate delivery time based on:
- Distance
- Traffic simulation
- Driver load
- Order density

### Stockout Risk Modeling
Predict stockout probability under demand uncertainty.

## ⚙️ Optimization Strategy

Minimize:
`Holding Cost + Stockout Cost + Transportation Cost + Ordering Cost`


Subject to:

- Warehouse capacity constraints  
- Supplier lead time variability  
- Driver availability  
- Delivery time thresholds  

---

## 🧪 Experimentation Framework

Evaluate competing strategies such as:

- Inventory policy A vs B  
- Routing algorithm A vs B  
- Warehouse allocation strategies  

Metrics evaluated:

- Service level %
- Average delivery time
- Stockout rate
- Total operational cost
- Statistical significance (p-values, confidence intervals)
